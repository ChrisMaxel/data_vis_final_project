        This is our data visualization project introduction for COS 326.



Requirements
================
1. Exercise your understanding of data visualization.
2. Showcase your ability and experience with data visualization techniques and tools
3. Clarifies the facts of a complex or controversial topic of relevance to contemporary society.



Data to Research
=================
    We plan to research and build complex datasets for the **Underlying and previous conditions of hospitalized or diseased Coronavirus patients**.



Questions
==============
    Topic
    ------
    <br><center>
        We are exploring the outcomes of COVID-19 ill or diseased patients and the underlying conditions they had. This may help identify key risks and how deadly each condition could be.  They are relevant because this could help people better understand their risks of dying from COVID-19.
        </center>
    <br><br>

    Audience
    ----------
    <br><center>
        People who are concerned, curious, or researching  the state of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
    </center>
    <br><br>

    Our Plan
    ------------------
    <br><center>
        We would like our visualizations to be **interactive** so our audience can be fully immersed into our visualizations.<br>
        We would also like **intuitive**, **honest**, and **unbiased** visualizations
        </center>
    <br><br>

    Impact
    --------
    <br>
        <center>
        We hope that these data visualizations will help people who are worried or interested in COVID-19 better understand the overall death rate and hospitalizations by displaying what patients have in common.

Visualization Ideas We Have <br><br> (maybe)
=============================
    Conditions Shown Through Area 
    -----------------------------
        - **Treemap** of previous conditions that have lead to the hospitalization of a person (specifically in America).
        ![Treemap](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/b3bfff05-380e-4dd9-b49b-7a2bfd128870.png)

    Copmarison of Conditions
    -----------------------
        - **Bar Chart** of previous conditions that have lead to the hospitalization of a person (specifically in America).
        ![Bar Chart](https://chartio.com/assets/f06f02/tutorials/charts/bar-charts/4231f2343fb3c86edcd9e468db398d33c18ab1c16c6d38a1afedf0e06ca8fc4d/bar-chart-example-3.png)
        
    Cloropleth
    -----------
        - Hospitalizations and or deaths by state with further specification of previous conditions.
