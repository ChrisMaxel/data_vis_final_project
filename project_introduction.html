        This is a data visualization project introduction for COS 326.



Requirements
================
1. Exercise your understanding of data visualization.
2. Showcase your ability and experience with data visualization techniques and tools
3. Clarifies the facts of a complex or controversial topic of relevance to contemporary society.



Data to Research
=================
    We plan to research and build complex datasets for the underlying and previous conditions of hospitalized or diseased Coronavirus patients.


Questions
==============
1. What research questions are you exploring? Why are they relevant?
    - We are exploring the outcomes of COVID-19 ill or diseased patients and the underlying conditions they had. This may help identify key risks and how deadly each condition could be.  They are relevant because this could help people better understand their risks of dying from COVID-19.

2. Who constitute your intended audience?
    - People who are concerned, curious, or researching  the state of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

3. What tools and techniques will you employ to visualize your data?
    - We would like our visualization to be interactive so that people can be fully immersed into our data.
    We would also like intuitive, honest, and unbiased visualizations

4. What impact do you hope your analysis and visualizations will have on your audience? How did you choose your analysis and visualization strategy to communicate clearly and honestly to your audience?
    - We hope that these data visualizations will help people who are worried or interested better understand the Coronavirus death rate and hospitalizations by displaying what patients have in common.


Visualization ideas we have
=============================
- A box like pie chart (put official name here)
- Choropleth ==>  hospitalizations by state --> by previous condition.
